**Projects**

These projects are numbered roughly in the order they should be completed.
Of course, you're free to complete these in any order.

---

Each project has a `Download` link to download the solution file.
Your solution may always look different than the provided solution - there are always multiple ways to solve a problem.

The solutions are there to provide clarity for how the program could/should work, as well as to give a nudge of guidance if you get stuck.

Trust me, looking at a solution is not cheating - you still need to understand the logic well enough to incorporate it into your project.
Even copy+paste is okay, real-world programmers do it all the time!
