# CSV Math

So here's the scenario: you work for a small personal financial planning company.
This morning you received an email from Robin in marketing:

> Hey!
>
> We're talking about running an ad and we want to include how much our clients' assets increase from our services.
Abby is working on finding a baseline - the average amount people's assets increase for comparison,
and Dayna found a bunch of spreadsheets of customer data
(with personal info redacted, mostly just the names have been converted into random ids).
> 
> As you can imagine, there are a LOT of files to go through,
so I'm really hoping your programming skills will come in useful here!
I've attached a .zip file with the spreadsheets (they're .csv files instead of .xlsx, I hope that's okay).
>
> Let me know if there's anything I can help you with. Thanks a ton!<br/>
